<p>
  An attempt at wrapping a more fully functioning engine around python's pygame module - hardly original work, but I figured I'd do it anyway,
  especially as working off of pygame from scratch every time I want to play around with certain kinds of 2D visual simulation in python is a
  little tedious (and probably a bad idea anyway)
</p>

# Experimentation

I've started to include a bunch of experimental implementations of games / frontends using the engine

Use of these is currently done by installing gamethonic to an environment and then coping the experimentation folder to that
environment.
