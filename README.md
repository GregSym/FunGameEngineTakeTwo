<p>
  An attempt at wrapping a more fully functioning engine around python's pygame module - hardly original work, but I figured I'd do it anyway,
  especially as working off of pygame from scratch every time I want to play around with certain kinds of 2D visual simulation in python is a
  little tedious (and probably a bad idea anyway)
